my first try of php project .including basic functions of E-business. 
it made up by two parts:home front page and admin after control terminal;
front page to show goods,user login,user regist,user information,user order.it's all construct by MVC model;
after terminal contain basic statistics fist-page,user controll,goods controll,order controll and classify controll;
regist-page used phone message function,test fine;

but this project is done just after a two months' study,it's security identify function already doesn't exist,normal SQL inject attack could easyly broken it,maybe later i will done it;
